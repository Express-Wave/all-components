Through preaching is God’s Word able to be made clear to the human mind and applied to the human heart.',

You wake up, put on the clothes your mom picks out for you, and head off to a school where you walk in a line and take naps after lunch. But somewhere along the way, middle-school happens, which is followed by something even more radical-high school! Life is fast!',
				'During these years, its so easy to get lost in the shuffle of school. So many wake up in their twenties and thirties realizing that they have made terrible mistakes in their teens and early twenties that could have been avoided. What may be even more tragic is the growing number of young adults who are leaving church, never to return.',

Our music is primarily directed toward God as a declaration of what He has done in our lives and hearts, proclaiming a complete dependence on and dedication to Christ’s work on the Cross.These verses from Psalm 96 capture the heart of what Christian music should be: praise to the Maker and Savior of man from a worship filled heart. Due to the wonder, awe and praise stored within the heart, the Christian should exclaim praise to God before a lost world: “He is the ‘rock of our salvation’, there is ‘no other God that can deliver’!” (Daniel 3:29). Through our songs and lives, may God be glorified and uplifted so that He might be seen as the God who is worthy of worship, praise and dedication.'

The sixty-six books contained in these Texts are the complete and divine revelation of God to Man. We believe that God kept His promise to preserve His Word to all generations (Psalm 100:5) and did so through the Hebrew Masoretic Text and the Received Text. The Scriptures are to be interpreted in context and light of the whole of scripture through a literal method of interpretation using normal grammatical-historical meaning. The Authorized King James Version of the Bible is currently the only English translation which is the preserved Word of God in that it is a formal equivalent (a word for word) translation of the preserved Hebrew Masoretic and Greek Received Texts. Therefore, it shall be the only translation used by the Church. All issues of interpretation and meaning shall be determined by the Pastor. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21; Psalms 12:6-7; 100:5)'

(John 16:8-11; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor. 3:6; Eph. 1:13-14)',

				'4. We believe that the sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues, the gift of healing, and the gift of prophesy were temporary. Speaking in tongues was a sign to unbelieving Jews that God was going to judge them for their apostasy. It was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or filling of the Holy Spirit. Ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the consummation of our salvation in the resurrection, although God frequently chooses to answer the prayers of believers for physical healing.

We believe that the Word of God teaches the security of the believer, that God will keep securely in His hand (John 10:25-30) those who are trusting in Jesus, but offers absolutely no hope for that person who is not trusting in Christ (I Peter 1:5). The link that unites God and man is faith in Christ (John 3:16). The security of the believer is based upon a continuous faith in Jesus Christ (Col 1:21-23; John 3:16; Heb. 3:12-13). We believe that the Scriptures present the possibility of an authentic believer ceasing to believe (I John 2:24; Heb. 3:12-13) but not in the probability (Heb. 6:9).

				'1. Ecclesiastical Separation: Separation of the church from the world is taught in scripture and is to be 	practiced by believers (2 Cor. 6:17; I Thess. 5:22). The church as a group of 	believers will not associate with churches which use worldly methods to promote 	the gospel. The church is to minister to the individuals in the world by giving out 	the gospel message through personal testimony, written material, evangelism, 	personal witnessing, church services and other methods, but it is not to use the 	worlds system of fulfilling sinful lusts through worldly entertainment, immorality, 	or other ungodly practices (James 4:4) in order to attract people to services. 	Therefore the church as a group, or as any sub-group, (i.e. youth, teens, ladies 	groups etc.) will not host, produce, nor participate in conferences, camps, 	fellowships, or other activities with churches or organizations which do not 	maintain a fundamental philosophy toward ministry and choose to use worldly 	attractions to draw people. Examples of these activities would include churches 	which host contemporary music concerts, or conferences which feature speakers 	that are neo-evangelical or charismatic in philosophy and practice, or meetings of 	an ecumenical nature with those which do not adhere to Bible principles and 	standards.

God commands His people to separate from all religious apostasy, all worldly and sinful pleasures, practices, and associations, and to refrain from all immodest and immoderate appearances, piercings, and bodily markings. We stand against any and all worldly philosophies that seek to destroy or undermine the truth of Biblical Christianity by engaging in questionable activities which may not be expressly prohibited by name in scripture but certainly are prohibited or discouraged by Bible principles, such as nakedness,	immodest dress, viewing worldly and ungodly movies, listening to ungodly music, sexual 	immorality, the sale and use of tobacco in any form, drug abuse, pornography, etc. and other things which feed the flesh and hinder the believer’s walk in the Spirit.  We believe that Bible principles teach total abstinence from alcohol and as such believers should not be engaged in the sale or use of alcoholic beverages. Believers are to be free and separate from all oath-bound secret societies and partnerships with unbelievers.
